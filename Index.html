            <p class="alignp">Evil is Evil. Lesser, greater, middling… Makes no difference. The degree is arbitary. The
                definition’s
                blurred. If I’m to choose between one evil and another… I’d rather not choose at all. I kill monsters
                for coins, if you have any problem with monsters you just know where to come.

            <p class="alignp">Not many things matter to me anymore in the world other than the purpose for which I was
                made for.
                That, and it has mostly always been my swords which saved my life. I Don't Believe In Melitele, Don't
                Believe In Existence Of Other Gods Either...You Ask What I Believe In, In That Case. I Believe In The
                Sword.

                <h3 class="namecolor">Gaining Great Powers</h3>
                <p class="alignp">During the Trial of the Grasses, I exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that
                    grant
                    witchers
                    their
                    abilities. Accordingly, I was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered my hair
                    white
                    and may have given me greater speed, strength, and stamina than my fellow witchers.

                <h3 class="namecolor">Defeating Ereden</h3>
                <p> Once I used to ride with The Wild Hunt, but that was a long long ago. I fought
                    Ereden,
                    I managed to stab through one of the holes in Eredin's mask, taking out his left eye. Stunned, the
                    king
                    tried to resume the fight but I easily delivered a fatal blow to his abdomen and the king fell down.
